# Product Guidelines for Extt

## 1. Communication and Prose Style

All user-facing documentation, in-app text, and marketing materials should adhere to a **Concise and Direct** prose style. The primary goal is to prioritize brevity and clarity, ensuring that information is easy to understand and act upon. Jargon should be avoided wherever possible to maintain accessibility for a broad user base.

## 2. Brand Messaging

Brand communication should consistently convey a message of **Efficiency and Speed**. All messaging should highlight how Extt streamlines note-taking workflows, helping users to capture and manage information quickly and effectively.

## 3. Visual Identity

The visual identity for Extt across all its interfaces (terminal, desktop, and web) will be **Minimalist and Functional**. This design choice emphasizes clean lines, simple color palettes, and a strong focus on usability over ornamentation. The user interface should feel intuitive and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on their content.

## 4. User Feedback and Contributions

User feedback and community contributions will be managed in a **Structured and Centralized** manner. Dedicated platforms, such as GitHub Issues or a designated community forum, will be the primary channels for submitting bug reports, requesting new features, and engaging in community discussions. This approach ensures that all feedback is tracked, prioritized, and addressed systematically.

## 5. New Feature Development

The approach to developing and integrating new features will be guided by **Vision-Driven Innovation**. While user feedback is valuable, new feature development will be primarily aligned with the long-term product vision. This allows for forward-thinking innovation that anticipates future user needs and keeps the product on a cohesive and strategic path.
